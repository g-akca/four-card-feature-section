## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### Continued development

I would like to do more research on how to decide between Flexbox and CSS Grid. Also, I want to do a better job on setting the top border of cards with border radius, because mine don't look exactly straight like the original designs.

### Useful resources

- [grid-template-areas - CSS | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) - Reminded me of the syntax when using grid-template-areas.
